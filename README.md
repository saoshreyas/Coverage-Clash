Coverage Clash: How to Play

Game Overview
Coverage Clash simulates the competing forces in U.S. healthcare access between Policy Makers (who aim to improve healthcare access) and Insurance Companies (who aim to maximize profit). This turn-based strategy game models real-world healthcare policy dynamics with multiple interconnected metrics that players must carefully manage.

Players take turns executing actions that affect seven key metrics: Uninsured Rate, Public Health Index, Access Gap Index, Insurance Profit, Public Trust Meter, Insurance Influence, and Policy Maker Budget. Success requires understanding how actions create cascading effects across all metrics while managing both immediate needs and long-term strategic positioning.

## Roles and Objectives

### Policy Maker
**Primary Goal:** Reduce the Access Gap Index below 13 to win
**Secondary Goals:** Maintain public trust, manage budget effectively, improve public health

**Lose Conditions to Avoid:**
- Uninsured rate exceeds 17.8%
- Public Health Index drops below 30
- Access Gap Index rises above 45
- Public Trust Meter falls below 30%
- Budget reaches 0 (prevents most actions)

### Insurance Company
**Primary Goal:** Increase profit above $85 billion to win
**Alternative Win:** Force Policy Maker to lose by driving Access Gap Index above 45

**Lose Conditions to Avoid:**
- Uninsured rate exceeds 17.8% (hurts everyone)
- Public Health Index drops below 30 (system collapse)

## Key Game Mechanics

### Turn Structure
- Policy Maker goes first
- Players alternate turns
- Special conditions can grant bonus turns or skip turns
- Game continues until someone wins or loses

### Bonus Turns (Policy Maker Only)
The Policy Maker earns bonus turns when reaching certain Public Trust thresholds:
- 55% trust: First bonus turn
- 62% trust: Second bonus turn  
- 72% trust: Third bonus turn
Each bonus can only be earned once per game.

### Budget Management (Policy Maker)
Most Policy Maker actions require budget. Running low on funds limits options significantly. The "Request Funds" action can replenish budget but has a 30% chance of being intercepted by the Insurance Company.

## Policy Maker Actions & Strategy

### Expand Public Coverage (Cost: 17B)
**Effects:** Major access gap reduction (-6), improves public health (+5), reduces uninsured rate (-0.5%), but expensive
**Strategy:** Your most powerful action for winning, but requires significant budget planning. Best used when you have sufficient funds for follow-up actions.
**Special Note:** Can be blocked for 2 turns if Insurance Company intercepts your funding request

### Subsidize Coverage (Cost: 11B) 
**Effects:** Moderate access gap reduction (-3), improves public health (+4), cheaper than expansion
**Strategy:** More budget-friendly option for steady progress. Good for maintaining momentum without depleting resources.

### Request Funds (Cost: Free)
**Effects:** Usually grants +25B budget, but 30% chance of interception
**Strategy:** Essential for long-term viability. Risk vs. reward decision - do you request when desperate or when you can afford the risk?
**Nuance:** If intercepted, Insurance Company gets special "bribe" actions that can severely hamper your next few turns.

### Cap Premiums (Cost: 11B)
**Effects:** Moderate access improvement (-2), major trust boost (+5), blocks insurer premium increases for 3 turns
**Strategy:** Defensive action that prevents Insurance Company from using their most profitable move. Use when they're close to winning or when you need trust.

### Mandate Coverage (Cost: 7B)
**Effects:** Good access improvement (-4), large uninsured reduction (-1.0%), but small trust penalty (-2)
**Strategy:** Efficient action with slight political cost. The trust loss is usually manageable given the benefits.

### Invest in Clinics (Cost: 15B)
**Effects:** Moderate access improvement (-3), major health boost (+6), significant trust gain (+4)
**Strategy:** Well-rounded action that helps on multiple fronts. Good when you need to improve several metrics simultaneously.

### Pass
**Effects:** Lose trust (-5), access gap may worsen if already high
**Strategy:** Generally avoid unless absolutely necessary. Passing shows inaction and hurts your standing.

## Insurance Company Actions & Strategy

### Raise Premiums (Blocked during premium caps)
**Effects:** Major profit increase (+6B), worsens access gap (+3), increases uninsured rate (+0.8%)
**Strategy:** Your bread-and-butter profit action, but each use makes the Policy Maker's job easier and may trigger public backlash.

### Risk Selection  
**Effects:** Profit increase (+5B), major access gap worsening (+6), significant health impact (-4)
**Strategy:** Powerful but creates bad optics. Selecting only healthy patients is profitable but socially harmful.

### Narrow Provider Network
**Effects:** Moderate profit (+3B), major access problems (+5), hurts public health (-4)  
**Strategy:** Less profitable than other options but still effective. Limits where patients can receive care.

### Lobby Government (Requires 75+ influence, 3+ turns since last lobby)
**Effects:** Policy Maker loses their next turn, moderate access worsening (+3), influence boost (+5)
**Strategy:** Game-changing action that can disrupt Policy Maker momentum. Save for crucial moments when they're close to winning.
**Nuance:** High influence requirement means you need to build up to this. The cooldown prevents spam.

### Misinformation Campaigns (Cost: 3B profit)
**Effects:** Major influence boost (+8), reduces Policy Maker trust (-3), moderate access worsening
**Strategy:** Powerful influence builder that sets up future lobbying. Costs money but builds long-term advantages.

### Special Bribe Actions (Only when funds intercepted)
These powerful actions are only available when you successfully intercept a Policy Maker funding request:

**Prevent Expansion (Bribe):**
- Blocks Policy Maker from using "Expand Public Coverage" for 2 turns
- Major profit boost (+10B) and influence gain (+8)  
- **Strategy:** Use when Policy Maker is close to winning through expansion

**Fund Misinformation (Bribe):**
- Major trust damage to Policy Maker (-9)
- Major profit (+10B) and influence boost (+8)
- **Strategy:** Use when Policy Maker has high trust or is earning bonus turns

### Pass
**Effects:** Lose influence (-5), may lose profit if influence is low
**Strategy:** Sometimes necessary if you lack resources for better actions, but generally avoid.

## Advanced Strategic Considerations

### For Policy Makers:
- **Budget Timing:** Request funds when you can afford the risk of interception, not when desperate
- **Trust Management:** Higher trust grants bonus turns - invest in trust-building actions early
- **Defensive Play:** Monitor Insurance Company influence; use premium caps when they approach lobbying threshold
- **Win Condition Focus:** Don't get distracted by other metrics if you're close to the Access Gap victory condition

### For Insurance Companies:
- **Influence Building:** Build to 75+ influence early to unlock lobbying capabilities
- **Profit Timing:** Balance immediate profit with long-term strategic positioning
- **Interception Strategy:** When you intercept funds, choose bribe actions based on Policy Maker's current strategy
- **Dual Win Paths:** You can win by reaching 85B profit OR by making Policy Maker lose - adapt based on game state

### Risk Management (Both Players):
- **Uninsured Rate:** Both players lose if this exceeds 17.8% - don't ignore this shared threat
- **Public Health:** System collapse at <30 hurts everyone - balance competitive actions with system stability
- **Cascading Effects:** Actions have multiple consequences - consider all metric changes before acting

## Real-World Context
The game incorporates several real-world healthcare policy dynamics:
- **Lobbying Power:** Insurance companies' ability to influence policy through lobbying
- **Public Opinion:** How trust affects political viability of health policies  
- **Budget Constraints:** Government funding limitations for health programs
- **Market Dynamics:** How insurance practices affect access and outcomes
- **Interception/Corruption:** How special interests can redirect public resources
